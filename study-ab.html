<!-- Step 1: Business Context -->
<h2>Business Context</h2>
<p>
    This study focused on employee turnover patterns at a company. Employee attrition is a significant issue that affects productivity, morale, and recruitment costs. The goal of this analysis was to identify the key factors contributing to employees leaving the company.
</p>

<!-- Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization -->
<h2>Data Analysis & Visualization</h2>
<p>
    Using **Microsoft Excel**, I performed a deep dive into the company's HR dataset. I utilized pivot tables to summarize data by department, age, tenure, and salary. Pivot charts were created to visualize key trends and patterns, making the data easy to understand at a glance.
