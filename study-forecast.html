<!-- Step 1: Business Context -->
<h2>Business Context</h2>
<p>
    A fitness-tracker company, **Bellabeat**, wanted to analyze user data from a public dataset to gain insights into how people use their smart devices. These insights would be used to inform Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy and guide future business decisions.
</p>

<!-- Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization -->
<h2>Data Analysis & Visualization</h2>
<p>
    Using **R and RStudio**, I performed data cleaning and analysis on the raw data. This involved merging several datasets, handling missing values, and performing statistical analysis to identify usage patterns. I then created visualizations to clearly present the findings.
</p>

<!-- Step 3: Key Insights -->
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul class="list-none space-y-3 text-left pl-0 text-lg">
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Users who log data for all three metrics (activity, sleep, and weight) are more engaged and use the device for a longer period.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">There is a positive correlation between active time and logged sleep data, suggesting that more active users are also more conscious about their sleep habits.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Users who use the tracker less than 3 times a week tend to have a higher sedentary rate.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- Step 4: Recommendations -->
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>
    Based on these insights, I developed actionable recommendations to guide the marketing team's strategy:
</p>
<ul class="list-none space-y-3 text-left pl-0 text-lg">
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Develop a feature in the app to encourage and gamify the logging of all three metrics (activity, sleep, and weight).</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Launch a marketing campaign highlighting the link between activity and sleep, positioning Bellabeat as a holistic wellness solution.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Introduce a "weekly challenge" to incentivize low-activity users to reach a minimum usage goal and reduce sedentary behavior.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
