# My Data Analysis Process

I believe data analysis is more than just numbers. It’s storytelling with structure. My process follows five guiding stages:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ask</strong> → Define the business problem clearly.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare</strong> → Collect, clean, and understand the data sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze</strong> → Use statistical and exploratory techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualize</strong> → Communicate findings with clarity and design.</li>
  <li><strong>Share</strong> → Present insights with recommendations and actions.</li>
</ol>

This framework helps me stay consistent, transparent, and impactful when delivering insights.
