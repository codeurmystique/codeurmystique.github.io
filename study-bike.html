<!-- Step 1: Business Context -->
<h2>Business Context</h2>
<p>
    The bike-share company **Cyclistic** wanted to convert its casual riders into annual members. My task was to analyze data to understand the behavioral differences between the two groups and develop a strategy to increase memberships.
</p>

<!-- Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization -->
<h2>Data Analysis & Visualization</h2>
<p>
    Using **R and RStudio**, I performed data cleaning and analysis on the bike-share dataset. I identified key usage patterns, such as ride duration and time of week, and then visualized these findings to highlight the distinctions between casual and member riders.
</p>

<!-- Step 3: Key Insights -->
<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul class="list-none space-y-3 text-left pl-0 text-lg">
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Casual riders use bikes for much longer periods on average, suggesting they are on leisure rides rather than for commuting.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Riding patterns for casual users are concentrated on weekends, while members ride consistently during weekdays, likely for commuting purposes.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Docked bikes are favored by casual users, while members use a mix of classic and electric bikes, indicating different usage needs.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- Step 4: Recommendations -->
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>
    Based on these insights, I developed actionable recommendations to guide the marketing team's strategy:
</p>
<ul class="list-none space-y-3 text-left pl-0 text-lg">
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Launch a **"Weekend Explorer" marketing campaign** targeting casual riders, highlighting the cost savings of membership for longer, leisure trips.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Introduce a **tiered membership option** that offers a discounted rate for weekend-only usage to attract this specific user base.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800">Develop a feature in the mobile app that provides a **"cost saved" calculation** for casual riders, showing them how much they would have saved with a membership.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
