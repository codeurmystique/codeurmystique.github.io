<h1>Case Study 4: NYC Pricing Prediction Model</h1>

<!-- Phase 1: Plan -->
<p>
    This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict New York City taxi fares. The goal is to provide a predictive tool for both riders and drivers to estimate trip costs, improving transparency and efficiency in the transportation service. The data used is a public dataset from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

<!-- Phase 2: Analyze -->
<h2>2. Analyze: Data Cleaning and Exploration (Current Phase)</h2>
<p>
    This phase involves a deep dive into the raw data. The initial steps include data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, as well as feature engineering to create new variables that will improve the model's performance. The key objective is to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800"><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Filtering out trips with zero or negative fare amounts, removing incorrect pickup and drop-off coordinates, and addressing inconsistent data entries.</p>

        <span class="mr-2 text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-xl">&bull;</span>
        <p class="text-gray-800"><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Creating new features such as trip duration, distance, and time of day to better capture the factors influencing fare price.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-800"><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Visualizing the relationship between fare amount and other variables like distance, time of day, and passenger count to identify key drivers.</p>
