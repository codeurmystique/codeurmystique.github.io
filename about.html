<p>Hello, Iâ€™m <strong>Ogechi Laura Amajuoyi aka~Codeurmystique</strong>, a data analyst passionate about transforming raw numbers into meaningful insights. My approach is nostalgic and handcrafted, but always guided by modern analytical rigor. 
<br><br>
With experience across tools like Excel, R, SQL, Tableau, and Python, I combine storytelling with technical analysis to provide clear, actionable insights for businesses and communities.</p>

<p>I built this portfolio to showcase my thought process, visualizations, and full-cycle project journeys. Each case study reflects my ability to adapt tools to the problem at hand.</p>
